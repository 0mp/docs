# Metric and label naming

The metric and label conventions presented in this document are not required
for using Prometheus, but can serve as both a style-guide and collection of
best practices. Individual organizations might want to approach e.g. naming
conventions differently.

## Metric names

A metric name:

* should have a (single-word) application prefix relevant to the containing Prometheus domain
 * <code><b>prometheus</b>\_notifications\_total</code>
 * <code><b>indexer</b>\_requests\_latencies\_milliseconds</code>
 * <code><b>processor</b>\_requests\_total</code>
* must have a single unit (i.e. don't mix seconds with milliseconds)
* should have a units suffix
 * <code>api\_http\_request\_latency\_<b>milliseconds</b></code>
 * <code>node\_memory\_usage\_<b>bytes</b></code>
 * <code>api\_http\_requests\_<b>total</b></code> (for an accumulating count)
* should represent the same logical thing-being-measured across all label dimensions
 * request duration
 * bytes of data transfer
 * instantaneous resource usage as a percentage

As a rule of thumb, either the `sum()` or the `avg()` over all dimensions of a
given metric should be meaningful (though not necessarily useful). If it isn't
meaningful, split the data up into multiple metrics. For example, having the
capacity of various queues in the metric is good, mixing the capacity of a
queue with the current number of elements in the queue is not.

## Labels

Use labels to differentiate the characteristics of the thing that is being measured:

 * `api_http_requests_total` - differentiate request types: `type="create|update|delete"`
 * `api_request_duration_nanoseconds` - differentiate request stages: `stage="extract|transform|load"`

Don't put the label names in the metric name, as that's redundant and
will cause confusion if it's aggregated away.

CAUTION: <b>CAUTION:</b> Remember that every unique key-value label pair
represents a new time series, which can dramatically increase the amount of
data stored. Don't use labels to store dimensions with high cardinality (many
different label values), such as user IDs, email addresses, or other unbounded
sets of values.
