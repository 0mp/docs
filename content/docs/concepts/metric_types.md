# Metric Types

Prometheus offers three core metric types:

  * Counters
  * Gauges
  * Summaries

Each type is useful for a different purpose, so it is important to use the
right one for the right job.

Metric types are currently only differentiated in the client libraries (to
enable APIs tailored to the usage of the specific types) and in the wire
protocol. The Prometheus server does not yet make use of the type information
after ingesting samples as timeseries. This may change in the future.

## Counter

A _counter_ is a cumulative metric that represents a single numerical value
that only ever goes up. That implies that it cannot be used to count items
whose number can also go down, e.g. the number of currently running goroutines.
Those "counts" are represented by gauges.

A counter is typically used to count requests served, tasks completed, errors
occurred, etc.

Client library usage documentation for counters:

   * [Go](http://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Counter)
   * [Java](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/client/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/metrics/Counter.java)
   * [Java (simple client)](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/Counter.java)
   * [Ruby](https://github.com/prometheus/client_ruby#counter)

## Gauge

A _gauge_ is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can
arbitrarily go up and down.

Gauges are typically used for measured values like temperatures or current
memory usage, but also "counts" that can go up and down, like the number of
running goroutines.

Client library usage documentation for gauges:

   * [Go](http://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Gauge)
   * [Java](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/client/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/metrics/Gauge.java)
   * [Java (simple client)](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/Gauge.java)
   * [Ruby](https://github.com/prometheus/client_ruby#gauge)

## Summaries

A _summary_ samples observations (usually things like request durations) over
sliding windows of time and provides instantaneous insight into their
distributions, frequencies, and sums.

A summary reports the following information:

  * streaming **quantile values** of observed events, exposed as `<basename>{quantile="<quantile label>"}`
  * the **total sum** of all observed values, exposed as `<basename>_sum`
  * the **count** of events that have been observed, exposed as `<basename>_count`

This is quite convenient, for if you are interested in tracking latencies of an
operation in real time, you get three types of information reported for free
with one metric.

A typical use-case is the observation of request latencies or response sizes.

Client library usage documentation for summaries:

   * [Java](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/client/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/metrics/Summary.java)
   * [Java (simple client)](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/blob/master/simpleclient/src/main/java/io/prometheus/client/Summary.java)
