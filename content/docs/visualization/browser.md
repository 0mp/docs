# Expression browser


The expression browser is available at `/graph` on the Prometheus server, allowing you to enter any expression and see it's result either in a table or graphed over time.

This is primarily useful for ad-hoc queries and debugging, for consoles you should use [PromDash](../promdash/) or [Console templates](../consoles/).
