# Installing

## Using pre-compiled binaries

We plan on providing precompiled binaries for various platforms and even
packages for common Linux distributions soon. Once those are offered, it
will be the recommended way of installing Prometheus.

## From source

For building Prometheus from source, see the relevant [`README.md` section](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/README.md#use-make).

## Using Docker

TODO: Add docker instructions.
